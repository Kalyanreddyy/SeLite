CharSequenceManager
has     CharSequence sequence
        extends CharSequenceContinuous

Change
CharSequenceContinuous constructor to accept: available heap, max. matcheable length (in char)
--------


heap
|....|....|....|....|....|....|

FilterReplace.process(App, Run)
- if start() is past bufferedLength-matcheableLength, then ignore the match
- whether there was any match in the current buffer, or whether the last match was past  bufferedLength-matcheableLength, delete 0..bufferedLength-matcheableLength from the buffer, keep the rest in the buffer, and append up to  bufferedLength-matcheableLength more characters from input file
- using separate threads - see TODO in FilterReplace

CharSequenceManager
- add abstract int highestMatcheableIndex()
-- in CharSequenceManagerInMemory: return buffer.length()-1
-- in CharSequenceManagerInFile: return bufferedLength-matcheableLength (+-1)
