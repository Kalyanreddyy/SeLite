# An XPI can override chrome:// URI from another XPI. Also, 'override' works even if the overriden URI (the first parameter) is not registered at all (e.g. chrome://non-existing-package/content/non-existing-file). So, overriding between XPIs works, no matter in what order the XPIs are loaded (as far as there is maximum of one override per URI).

# Following lines are for a modified version of original SeleniumIDEGenericAutoCompleteSearch - to support indentation. I don't need to have 'interface' line here, so I don't need to duplicate components/SeleniumIDEGenericAutoCompleteSearch.xpt from Selenium IDE

# My unique class ID (it must be different to that of original SeleniumIDEGenericAutoCompleteSearch).

# My contract (its URL) can be the same or different to that of original SeleniumIDEGenericAutoCompleteSearch). But if the same, then I can't call registerFactory() for it again. So I use my own contract URL.
#I tried to call registerFactory() with my factory for the original contract URL in ide-extension.js, but that didn't work.
