# An XPI can override chrome:// URI from another XPI. Also, 'override' works even if the overriden URI (the first parameter) is not registered at all (e.g. chrome://non-existing-package/content/non-existing-file). So, overriding between XPIs works, no matter in what order the XPIs are loaded (as far as there is maximum of one override per URI).
