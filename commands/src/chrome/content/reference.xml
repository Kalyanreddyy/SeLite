               Use to record the moment when you inserted/updated a record of given type, and you want to
       compare that record's timestamp (whether soon or later) as formatted on the webpage (using given precision).
       This in conjunction with waitForDistinctTimestamp action make sure that you get timestamps which can be
       compared as distinct.
      Warning: This keeps a count only of timestamps notes since you started Selenium. If you re-started it soon
      after the previous run which could record timestamps, make sure you wait for a sufficient period to get distinct new timestamps.
