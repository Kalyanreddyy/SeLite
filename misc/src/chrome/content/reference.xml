    <param name="fileURL">URL of the file to load and run. It must be a local <code>chrome:, resource:</code> or <code>file:</code> URL.

    <param name="scope">Scope object. Optional. If present, it must an object passed through SelBlocksGlobal enhanced sytax =&lt;&gt;({ ... })&lt;&gt; (see http://selite.github.io/EnhancedSelenese).<br/>
        If you'd like sthe script to access 'document' object, use EhancedSelenese and pass <code>=&lt;&gt;({ document: selenium.browserbot.getDocument() })&lt;&gt;</code>.<br/>
        If scope is not passed, the file is loaded into Selenium Core scope.

        This loads and runs a privileged Javascript file. It doesn't cache it. This could load a Core extension, but don't use it for that. It's intended to load Javascript that tests functionality which would be too awkward to test directly from Selenese.<br/>If the file fails, this adds the stack trace to the error's message, so that the stack trace shows up in Selenium IDE log.
        <br/>
        This command is a part of SeLite Miscellaneous.
