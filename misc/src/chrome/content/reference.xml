        This loads and runs a privileged Javascript file. It doesn't cache it. This could load a Core extension, but don't use it for that. It's intended to load Javascript that tests functionality which would be too awkward to test directly from Selenese.<br/>If the file fails, this adds the stack trace to the error's message, so that the stack trace shows up in Selenium IDE log.

        This command is a part of SeLite Miscellaneous.
